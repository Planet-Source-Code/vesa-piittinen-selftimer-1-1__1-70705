## SelfTimer 1\.1


</div>

### Description

This is a self-contained timer class module. This means there is only one class module required, thus no external module file. This has been achieved by adapting SelfCallback code by Paul Caton and LaVolpe, but this time around I've simplified the code as the requirements in this kind of a class are minimal. Thus the code is much shorter and may give a better picture for some people on what is required for SelfCallback. Naturally the timer is IDE safe so you can hit pause and stop without a worry of crashing. 

----

Update 1.1: the code is now shorter and faster, code adapter from Paul's Universal DLL Caller. Now all code of interest is in Private_Start and Private_Stop.
